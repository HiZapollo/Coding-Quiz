# Coding Quiz

## Description

This website was created as a project in a coding bootcamp to teach me how to use more complex javascript to create a web application. It is a quiz with coding-related questions and answers. It currently has 5 questions, but adding more is fairly simple for the future. Your score is based on the time left after finishing the questions, so the highest score would be the closest to 100. Every answer that is wrong will subtract 10 seconds from the timer, effectively lowering your score whilst pressuring you more to finish. You can also view the high scores after submitting your own. You can clear these scores whenever by clicking the 'clear' button.

## Usage

This website can be used to test coding knowledge in order to get the highest score possible. Clicking the start button will begin the timer and show the questions, answering the questions will show the next. When wrong, the timer will go down by 10 seconds. When done with the last question, your score will be the time left, and you can submit your score with your initials. Scores can be viewed by clicking the 'View high scores' link on the top left of the page, or by submitting a new score. Scores can be cleared by clicking the 'clear' button.
